## Algorithm Details

### Collaborative Filtering
```python
# User-based: Find similar users
similarity = cosine_similarity(user_vectors)
prediction = weighted_average(similar_users_ratings)

# Item-based: Find similar items
similarity = cosine_similarity(item_vectors)
prediction = weighted_average(similar_items_ratings)
```

### Matrix Factorization
```python
# Decompose user-item matrix
R ≈ U × V^T
# Where U = user factors, V = item factors
```

### Content-Based Filtering
```python
# Create item profiles from features
item_profile = combine(categorical, numerical, textual_features)
user_profile = average(liked_items_profiles)
recommendations = most_similar(user_profile, all_items)
```

## Use Cases

### E-commerce
- Product recommendations
- Cross-selling and upselling
- Personalized shopping experiences

### Media & Entertainment
- Movie/music recommendations
- Content discovery
- Playlist generation

### Social Platforms
- Friend suggestions
- Content feed optimization
- Community recommendations

## Performance Considerations

### Scalability
- Use approximate algorithms for large datasets
- Implement distributed computing for massive scale
- Consider real-time vs. batch processing trade-offs

### Memory Optimization
- Sparse matrix representations
- Incremental learning for streaming data
- Model compression techniques

### Cold Start Solutions
- Demographic-based recommendations
- Popular item fallbacks
- Active learning for new users

## Evaluation Metrics

### Accuracy Metrics
- **RMSE**: Root Mean Square Error for rating prediction
- **MAE**: Mean Absolute Error for rating prediction

### Ranking Metrics
- **Precision@K**: Fraction of recommended items that are relevant
- **Recall@K**: Fraction of relevant items that are recommended
- **NDCG@K**: Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain

### Business Metrics
- **CTR**: Click-through rate
- **Conversion Rate**: Purchase conversion from recommendations
- **Revenue Impact**: Direct business value

## Advanced Topics

### Deep Learning Approaches
- Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF)
- Autoencoders for collaborative filtering
- Recurrent networks for sequential recommendations

### Handling Bias
- Selection bias in implicit feedback
- Popularity bias mitigation
- Fairness in recommendations

### Real-time Systems
- Online learning algorithms
- Streaming data processing
- Low-latency inference

## Example Usage

```python
from recommender_systems import CollaborativeFilteringRecommender

# Initialize recommender
recommender = CollaborativeFilteringRecommender(method='item_based')

# Train on interaction data
recommender.fit(interactions_df)

# Generate recommendations
recommendations = recommender.recommend(user_id=123, n_recommendations=10)

# Predict ratings
predictions = recommender.predict(user_id=123, item_ids=[1, 2, 3])

# Save model
recommender.save_model('cf_model.pkl')
```
